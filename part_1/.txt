The following code is meant to help you run your image processing code. It has a CLI (Command Line Interface) with two options:

Run the code from a specific directory (either the default one from the code or a custom one that you can create).
Run the code with a specific image, and if available, with its polygon file to check in the end if your code is correct.

The function that you're aiming to implement is find_tfl_lights. Look at the documentation for a better understanding of the input/output.

At the end of every run, a window displaying your image, along with the coordinates that you've provided, will appear. This feature is primarily for your convenience and is not part of the exercise. Its look may vary between different IDEs, so there's no need to get hung up on it.

If you're curious and have extra time, you can find more information about the interactive window here:
